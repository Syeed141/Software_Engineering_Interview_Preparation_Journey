# Software Engineering Interview Prep Journey

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

This repo is my personal workspace for practicing and mastering essential topics for software engineering interviews. Iâ€™m focusing on writing clean, efficient C++ code and understanding core concepts to nail my upcoming job interviews.

## What Iâ€™ve Learned So Far

* **Arrays** â€” fundamentals, common problems, and tricks
* **STL** â€” vectors, sets, maps, stacks, queues, and useful utilities
* **Strings** â€” manipulation, parsing, and case conversions
* **Time Complexity** â€” analyzing code efficiency and Big O notation

I update this repo regularly as I add new topics and solve more problems.
